Whether Joseph Mhlongo will still be a player for Black Leopards, come next season, remains to be seen. Mhlongo’s contract with Lidoda Duvha will expire at the end of June. According to the player’s manager, Mr Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi of Rush Hour Sports Management, several clubs have shown interest in his services. Mulovhedzi revealed that Black Leopards would be given preference. According to him, negotiations with Black Leopards were at an advanced stage and the deal could be sealed anytime soon. Mulovhedzi said that although his wish was to see Mhlongo in the Leopards’ outfit after the expiry of the player’s current contract with the club, the matter would depend on whether the club was willing to bend to their demands. Mulovhedzi further stated that both the player and his company had enjoyed their relationship with Black Leopards over the past three years.  “Black Jesus”, as he is affectionately called, joined the Thohoyandou side on 1 July 2017 on a three-year contract. According to Mulovhedzi, the player did not sign a pre-season agreement with any club so far because they wanted to give Black Leopards priority. He stated that they would consider offers from other clubs should their negotiations with the player’s current employers reach a deadlock. He further revealed that he was supposed to have met with the management of Black Leopards last week and that the meeting had been rescheduled due to the lockdown. “I think that would have been our last meeting with the club, considering the fact that much work has already been done and that we are in the final stage of negotiating the contract,” said Mulovhedzi. Mr Elijah Mulaudzi, the general manager of Leopards, confirmed that their negotiations to retain the 29-year-old midfielder were going well.
