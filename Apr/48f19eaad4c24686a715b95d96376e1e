Black Leopards will not be relegated to the lower division at the end of this season if the words of the team’s striker, Mwape Musonda, are anything to go by. The Zambian international said Lidoda Duvha would collect enough points to push them out of the relegation quagmire in their remaining six matches. The Thohoyandou side were languishing at the bottom of the log when the league activities came to a halt three weeks ago with the national lockdown. When responding to WhatsApp messages, Musonda said Black Leopards did not deserve to be where they are now because they have a pool of talent. Musonda went on to say that he felt that they had underachieved as a team, adding that the team was under the guidance of a knowledgeable coach, Mr Allan Clark. The former Orlando Pirates and Lamontville Golden Arrows forward further indicated that he felt that he had not done enough for the team this season. Musonda scored five goals in the 24 league matches the team has played to date. Musonda vowed that he would make sure that the opposition defenders felt his presence in their remaining six league matches. The Premier Soccer League’s 2018/19 soccer season top goal scorer appealed to the Leopards supporters not to panic, saying things would soon change for the better. According to him, the players too were equally concerned about the team’s poor performance this season. Three of their remaining six matches will be played in front of their home crowd. Lidoda Duvha’s home fixtures will be against Maritzburg United, SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits. Their away fixtures will be against Lamontville Golden Arrows, Amazulu and Mamelodi Sundowns. Should they manage to collect 10 points in their remaining six matches, Leopards will be sure of retaining their Absa Premiership status. To simplify things for themselves, Leopards must win all their home matches and grab at least one point in the three away matches.
