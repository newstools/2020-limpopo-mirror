At the age of 12, the future of a young female football referee, Ndofhiwa Pretty Makena, looks bright. Born at Tshakhuma village on 10 April 2007, the diminutive ref revealed that her desire to follow refereeing as a career started when she was a Grade 6 pupil at Mmboswobeni Primary School. According to her, nothing could stop her from watching soccer games on television. Although she had the desire to become a professional football player one day, her primary focus was on the referees when she watched games on television. She was prompted to approach her teacher, Mr Nkhumiseni Nyambeni, to guide her on refereeing. Nyambeni is the current referee selector for the SAB and the ABC Motsepe Leagues. Realizing that Ndofhiwa had talent, Nyambeni advised her to attend training sessions and workshops as the starting point. Ndofhiwa commenced her career as an assistant referee in the MMK Administrators League matches in the 2018/19 soccer season. She praised the players and officials of the various teams for the role they played towards the success of her career. According to her, the players and officials gave her the necessary advice and guidance when she committed mistakes, even at times when her mistakes would cost their teams valuable points. Ndofhiwa, a Grade 8 pupil at Lwamondo High School, stated that she had never received any threat in her life as a referee. When asked as to where she wanted to see herself in five yearsâ€™ time, Ndofhiwa said that her dream was to officiate at international level soon. She cited three local professional referees, Messrs Olani Kwinda, Jelly Chabani and Khamusi Razwimisani, as her role models. She wants to follow chemical engineering as a career after passing Grade 12.
