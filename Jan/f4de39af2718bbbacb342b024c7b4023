The Mukhomi Community Forum from Malamulele handed over a motorised wheelchair to a local Grade 4 pupil, Tebogo Baloyi, in December last year. Tebogo was born with a disability that has left him unable to walk or move without assistance. The motorised wheelchair was donated to the young man by the Rotary Club of Northcliff, Johannesburg. The forum asked the club for assistance on behalf of his mother, Audrey Baloyi. According to the secretary of the forum, Mr Rhulani Mhlanga, they first arranged for the child to be medically examined. The recommendation was that Tebogo needed an electric wheelchair because of his condition, as opposed to a manual wheelchair that demands his strength to move around. The forum then wrote to various stakeholders requesting assistance. The Rotary Club of Northcliff came to the rescue and arranged for such a specialised wheelchair to be delivered. “The donation of this wheelchair has helped uplift the child’s confidence and his health condition will improve. The Mukhomi Community Forum wishes him well with his new life and believe this donation will help him achieve much better grades at school as he is a brilliant young man,” said Mhlanga. “The forum would also like to thank all community structures for their support, including Chief Mukhomi, the ward councillor, Ms Vhukeya, Mr Hlabangwani Ronald from an organisation dealing with people with disabilities and the office of the mayor of the Collins Chabane Local Municipality, Mr SG Maluleke, for their words of encouragement and support.”
