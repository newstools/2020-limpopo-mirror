They lost 0-1 to SuperSport United in their Multichoice Diski Challenge League match at the Tsakane Stadium outside Johannesburg last Saturday, and now Black Leopards have another long trip to undertake this weekend. They will travel to Durban where they will lock horns with Amazulu at the King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday afternoon. With 11 matches remaining before the end of the season, Black Leopards’ case looks hopeless. Lidoda Duvha are still to win a league match to date. They managed to collect only six points from the 19 matches they have played to date. Although things are moving from bad to worse over time in the camp, the team’s head coach, Mr Mongezi Bobe, is still adamant that the team’s fortunes will soon change. He appealed to the team’s fans not to throw in the towel, saying things would soon take a new shape in their camp. He stressed the fact that much can still happen in their remaining 11 league matches. The Thohoyandou side will pin their hopes on Selby Rapatsa and Amukelani Chauke for goals. Also, on Sunday, Kaizer Chiefs will host SuperSport United at the Dobsonville Stadium in Johannesburg. Kaizer Chiefs are still in a celebratory mood, following their 4-1 victory over Highlands Park last Sunday. Orlando Pirates will battle it out for league points against Cape Town City at the Malta Park Sports Grounds. Highlands Park will host Bloemfontein Celtic in one of the five matches that will be played tomorrow. The title chasers, Bidvest Wits, will host Polokwane City. Wits are in the second position on the log with 43 points, four behind the pace setters, Mamelodi Sundowns. The other fixtures are: Baroka FC vs Stellenbosch FC, Chippa United vs Mamelodi Sundowns and Maritzburg United vs Lamontville Golden Arrows.
