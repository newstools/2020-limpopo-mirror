The going is quickly getting tough for Black Leopards FC. They are expected to play three league matches within the space of seven days. They lost 1-2 to Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa last Sunday afternoon. Lidoda Duvha came back home to entertain Chippa United at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday evening. Their next stop will be in Bloemfontein, where they will meet Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Asked about the team’s level of readiness for their Sunday match against Bloemfontein Celtic, the team’s head coach, Mr Kevin Johnson, was quick to indicate that the spirit was high in the camp. He further indicated, however, that he was still battling to find a winning combination. Sunday’s match will be the third for Mr Johnson as the team’s head coach. He sat on the team’s technical bench for the first time in their game against Highlands Park after his appointment last week. Khuliso Mudau, Karabo Tshepe and Lifa Hlongwane, the Leopards’ crowd pullers, are expected to be in the team’s starting 11 after watching their teammates do the job from the grandstand for several weeks. In the other Absa Premiership League matches that will also be played on Sunday, Amazulu will have a date with SuperSport United in Durban. Amazulu are fighting for survival as they are currently lying at the bottom of the log. Kaizer Chiefs will host Cape Town City and Baroka FC and Polokwane City will meet in a Limpopo derby at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in one of the three matches that will be played tomorrow. Highlands Park and Stellenbosch FC will meet at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. The match between Chippa United and Maritzburg United will be played at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Next Wednesday’s (15 January) fixtures are Bidvest Wits vs Bloemfontein Celtics and Orlando Pirates vs Mamelodi Sundowns.
