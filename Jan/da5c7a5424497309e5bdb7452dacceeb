The Manavhela family of Madabani was left shocked on Sunday after a 65-year-old family member burnt to death inside his house. The house was also severely damaged by the fire. The pensioner, Mr Thema Manavhela, was bedridden after a stroke. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Manavhela was alone when the fire broke out. The rest of the family attended a church service when the incident took place. According to the family spokesperson, Mr Lekgapa Manavhela, the incident happened at around 17:00. People from the village gathered at the homestead but could do nothing. When firefighters arrived at the scene, they doused the flames. Manavhela estimates the damage at approximately R500 000. The fire also seriously damaged the roof and the walls of all seven rooms. A plea was made to community members and the business sector to assist the family with food, clothes, school uniforms and books. “The family wants to repair the house, but it seems as if it will be difficult,” said a community member, Mr Sy Mukhuba. He urged members of the bereaved family and all stakeholders involved in the preparations for the funeral to be united and work together to ensure that Manavhela gets a dignified funeral. The deceased will be buried on Saturday at Madabani at 06:00.
