After a month-long break for the festive season, the affiliates of the Multichoice Diski Challenge League will be back in action again this weekend. Black Leopards will resume their programme with an away fixture. They will undertake a journey to Johannesburg, where they will test their strength against SuperSport United at the Tsakane Stadium tomorrow morning (Saturday) at 10:00. A quick look at the log standings shows that Lidoda Duvha will be lucky if they manage to come back home with a point in hand. SuperSport United are lying in the sixth spot on the log with 28 points accumulated from 18 matches. While United will be fighting it with the aim of finishing their league programme within the top-eight bracket, the situation is totally different for the Thohoyandou side. Black Leopards are currently lying at the bottom of the log. They are still to win a league match this season. They have managed to deposit six points into their league account to date. Whether the Leopardsâ€™ strikers, Selby Rapatsa and Amukelani Chauke, will have enough strength to penetrate through the defence of United remains to be seen. At the same venue tomorrow, Orlando Pirates will lock horns with Mamelodi Sundowns, starting at 12:00. Sundowns are currently leading the pack, while Pirates are in the third position. Bloemfontein Celtic will entertain Amazulu at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein. In one of the four matches that will be played on Sunday, Lamontville Golden Arrows will host Chippa United at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Durban. The other three Sunday fixtures are: Cape Town City vs Maritzburg United, Polokwane City vs Baroka FC and Highlands Park vs Kaizer Chiefs.
