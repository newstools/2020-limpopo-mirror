Speculation has ended and become reality. The much-talked-about sale agreement between Bidvest Wits Football Club and the former president of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) FC, Mr Masala Mulaudzi, was finally concluded on Saturday evening, ending weeks of speculation. Mulaudzi has confirmed the transaction. Mulaudzi revealed that more information regarding the sale agreement would be released soon. He confirmed, however, that the franchise was a package that included the players. Mulaudzi was under immense pressure over the past weeks from TTM’s concerned supporters who wanted to know why he had sold TTM’s GladAfrica Championship status to Mr Simon Malatjie before he could clinch a deal with the Absa Premiership club from whom he was intending to procure the status. The chairman of Bidvest Wits FC, Mr Alan Fainman, also confirmed the deal, adding that they would soon issue a media statement.
