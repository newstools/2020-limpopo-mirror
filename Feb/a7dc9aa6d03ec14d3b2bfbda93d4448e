Mr Juneas Lekgetha was elected as the new chairperson of the University of Venda (Univen) council during a meeting held at Euphoria Golf and Lifestyle Estate in Mookgophong a fortnight ago. He thanked the council for electing him as their chairperson and for showing confidence in him. "I am familiar with the activities of the university and its purpose in the community of Limpopo and the country at large," he said. “This institution is a modern institution serving the future generations of the Republic of South Africa. Our role as the council is to ensure that this university fulfils its mandate and contributes to the seven developmental principles of the country as stated by Pres Cyril Ramaphosa in his 2019 State of the Nation Address." He said that his role was to ensure that the council worked towards its mandate, using the best technology and best practices. “We must ensure that we share the values of the university with the community in which we exist and continue to spearhead and support initiatives that are meant to uplift the young generation in these communities. This university aims to be a global leader in knowledge management and leadership.” He is currently the executive chairman of the Borutho Group.
