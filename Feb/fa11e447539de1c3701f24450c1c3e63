“We might have squandered a lot of scoring chances, but the good thing is that we have won the match,” the coach of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), Mr Lucky Nelukau, said shortly after his team had beaten Steenberg United 1-0 in their GladAfrica Championship League match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. TTM were all over the visitors from the Western Cape throughout the game, but their strikers let them down by fumbling at the goal finish as usual. Nelukau said that he knew the supporters might be worried about the fact that they had squandered numerous scoring chances in the game. He appealed to them not to press the panic button, saying the team was still on course for the league title.  He stressed the fact that collecting the maximum points against Steenberg was the best thing for everyone in the club after the team had lost their previous two matches. TTM lost 0-1 to Richards Bay FC and 0-2 to University of Pretoria before making a comeback last Saturday. He reiterated the fact that they will have enough time to prepare for their next match against Cape Umoya United that will be played at the Cape Town Stadium next Friday, 28 February. TTM were without their killer striker, Thembisani Nevhulamba, last Saturday. He was nursing an injury he sustained in their game against University of Pretoria three weeks ago. TTM will be out of action this weekend as most of the teams will be engaged in their Nedbank Cup KO competition matches. The Tshakhuma side were booted out of the competition by Uthongathi FC in the preliminary-round stage. TTM moved two steps up on the log standings after last Saturday’s victory. They are now in the fifth position with 32 points accumulated from 21 matches. Ajax Cape Town are still leading the pack, while Royal Eagles are at the bottom of the log.
