Hundreds of angry demonstrators, including students of TVET Capricorn College, attended Tuesday’s hearing of the suspect arrested in connection with the murder of Precious Ramabulana. The suspect, Aubrey Manaka (28), made a quick appearance in the Morebeng Magistrate’s Court. Manaka is accused of stabbing the 21-year-old student 52 times. The police and security officers had to close the main gate of the court building as community members wanted to enter the building to have a glance at the suspect. The marchers demanded that the suspect should never be given bail. Manaka pleaded not guilty on all five charges against him. He will remain in custody until his next court appearance on 30 March. When Manaka eventually made his appearance in the court room on Tuesday, he looked calm and walked confidently to the dock, even though he had chains around his legs. He is facing five charges, namely murder, theft, housebreaking and two of rape. One of the rape charges is for a four-year-old toddler that was raped in 2014.
