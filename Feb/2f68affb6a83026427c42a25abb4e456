“I don’t mind whom we meet in the quarterfinal, but my only wish is to win the home-ground advantage and play in front of our home crowd like we did in the first two stages of the competition,” said the caretaker coach of Black Leopards, Mr Allan Clark, during an interview after his team beat Amavarara FC 2-0 in their round-16 stage match of the Nedbank Cup KO competition at the Thohoyandou Stadium last Friday evening. According to him, the eight teams that reached the quarterfinal stage did not do so by default and they were all good. Clark further indicated that he believed that “if you want to become a champion, you must first beat the champion”.  Leopards became the first team to qualify for the quarterfinals, following their victory over Amavarara. Lesedi Kapinga opened the Leopards’ account with a half volley nine minutes into the game. Themba Ndlovu scored the second towards the end of the first half. Khanya Mini, the keeper of Amavarara, was nominated Man of the Match. He received a trophy after the game. The other teams that qualified for the quarterfinals are: Mamelodi Sundowns, Baroka FC, TS Sporting, Real Kings, Highlands Park, Bloemfontein Celtics and Bidvest Wits. The quarterfinal draw was conducted at the Supersport studios in Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. Unfortunately Clark's, his side will not play their quarterfinal match at home. Instead, they will travel to Polokwane where they will rub shoulders with Baroka FC. The other quarterfinal fixtures are TS Sporting vs Bloemfontein Celtics, Real Kings vs Bidvest Wits and Highlands Park vs Mamelodi Sundowns. The quarterfinal matches will be played over the weekend of 14 and 15 March. This year’s champions will go home with a whopping R7 million.
