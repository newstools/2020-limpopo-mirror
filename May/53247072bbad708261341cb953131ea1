The Thulamela Local Football Association (Thulfa) will complete their current league programme, even though the South African Football Association (SAFA) and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) are still to make an announcement regarding the resumption of the league’s activities. This was confirmed by the chairman of the association, Mr Ephraim “Makhanda” Singo. According to Singo, only the dates on which the league programme will be concluded will be affected. He stated that they would adjust their league programme after their mother body had made an announcement regarding the resumption of league activities. Singo indicated that their current league programme was likely to stretch until the end of November. He revealed that although their league programmes normally start in October and end in June, they would still be able to complete their current league programme within a reasonable time without affecting the programme ahead. Singo admitted, however, that they would not be able to accommodate all tournaments and competitions that they had staged in the previous years when circumstances were normal. The annual MTG/PIB KO competition will not take place, due to the time already lost. According to him, they should have started with the competition the first weekend of April. The final for the MTG/PIB KO competition is usually staged on 16 June each year. Singo also said that the Thulamela Mayoral Cup Tournament would not be staged this year. He said the final of the Mayoral Cup Tournament was scheduled to be staged this month. Singo further revealed that the only competition that they will be able to stage is the Mpho Mathoho Electrical KO competition. This competition will be staged at the end of the season as an off-season tournament.
