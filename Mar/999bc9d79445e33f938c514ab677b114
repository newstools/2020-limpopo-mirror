Thabo Sibanze (27), who is accused of murdering a South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) member and intimidating members of Samwu, made another appearance in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court last Friday. Sibanze allegedly sent threatening messages to Samwu leaders who criticised the Vhembe District Municipality for investing more than R300 million in the liquidated VBS bank. He is also linked to the killing of Samwu leader Ronald Mani. Mani and another Samwu leader, Mr Timpson Musetsho, were gunned down in two separate incidents in the Thohoyandou area last year. Police investigations into both murders are continuing. Limpopo police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo praised the team of investigators for ensuring that Sibandze was officially charged with murder in court. Sibandze was initially arrested for intimidation on 1 March 2019 in Vosloorus in Gauteng. He was also charged under the Immigration Act, because he did not possess the necessary documents to be in the country, Mojapelo said. Sibandze will return to court on 25 May.
