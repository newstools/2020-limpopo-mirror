The struggle for promotion and to avoid relegation at the end of the season is becoming hotter by the day in the GladAfrica Championship League. With seven matches remaining before the end of the season, indications of which team will gain automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership and which ones will take part in the promotional playoffs are still not clear. A quick glance at the remaining fixtures for Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) shines the spotlight on the fact that Vhadau Vha Damani stand a good chance of lifting the league trophy and gaining automatic promotion to the elite division. Four of their seven remaining matches will be against teams that are in hot contention for the league title. The four league-title contenders they must play before the end of the season are: JDR Stars, Ajax Cape Town, Uthongathi FC and Swallows FC. Their match against JDR Stars will be played at the Soshanguve Giant Stadium outside Pretoria tomorrow afternoon. They will host Ajax Cape Town and Uthongathi FC and wrap up their league activities with an away match against Swallows FC. Should they manage to beat the four league-title contenders, TTM will have a good chance of gaining automatic promotion. The other three teams that TTM will meet in their remaining fixtures are: Jomo Cosmos (away), Free State Stars (away) and TS Sporting (home). TTM are currently lying in the fourth position on the log standings. They have 38 points, seven fewer than the log leaders, Ajax Cape Town. Swallows FC and Uthongathi FC have 40 and 39 points respectively.
