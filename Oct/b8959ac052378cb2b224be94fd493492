The relationship between Black Leopards Football Club and the team’s midfielder, Robert Ngambi, is something of the past. According to the club’s director, Mr Tshifhiwa Thidiela, Ngambi’s initial contract expired on 30 June. At that stage, the government was still to give the Premier Soccer League the go-ahead to play their remaining league matches behind closed doors. In July, the government finally gave the league the thumbs-up to complete their 2019/20 league programme. That prompted most of the clubs, including Black Leopards, to extend their players’ expired contracts by two months. The only Leopards’ player whose contract was not extended after 30 June was Joseph Mhlongo. Ngambi, together with the likes of Mogakolodi Ngele, Tswarelo Bereng and Thobang, were lucky to have their contracts extended until 31 August. Following the expiry of Ngambi’s contract at the end of August, the club opened negotiations with the player. According to Thidiela, after considering a number of things, the club decided against renewing the contract of the Malawian international. Speaking to Limpopo Mirror after his departure from the Leopards’ camp on Tuesday, the 34-year-old midfielder thanked Black Leopards for according him an opportunity to revive his football career. He revealed that most of the people had written him off after he had parted ways with his former employers, Platinum Stars FC. Asked about his next move, Ngambi said that he was still weighing up offers. He revealed that indications were that he might join another DStv Premiership club before the activities of the new season started next week. Ngambi joined the Thohoyandou side at the beginning of last season on a 12-month contract.
